 * "Angel of Death": Superb Warfare's AC-130H gunship flown and gunned by four hidden AI crew members.
 *
 *  - Crew: seat 0 is the pilot, seats 1-3 are the gunners of the [Ac130Gun]s (M61, Bofors, M102). All four are
 *    [BossCrewEntity] instances that the boss re-creates and re-seats whenever one goes missing.
 *  - Ammunition: a creative ammo box lives in the vehicle inventory, so the guns draw from an unlimited supply (they
 *    still use their normal magazine / reload timers). The brain's own limited-ammo mode sits on top of that.
 *  - Fuel: [consumeEnergy] does nothing and the energy store is topped up.
 *  - Health: finite, shown in a boss bar that empties at 10% (where SBW's aircraft engine switches to its crash
 *    branch). The bar, the crash and the payout live in the shared [BossLifecycle].
 *  - Players cannot board, loot, repair or tow it.
 *
 * Tick order matters. [Ac130BossBrain.tick] writes the flight controls **before** `super.baseTick()` so they are in
 * place when SBW's `travel()` runs the aircraft engine. [Ac130BossBrain.applyGunnerAim] runs **after** it, because
 * `positionRider` re-applies the vehicle's yaw change to every rider during the tick and SBW reads the gunner's
 * rotation for its (deferred) shots afterwards.
