/**
 * Detects homing missiles that are tracking the boss and drives the flare response.
 *
 * A missile is a threat when it implements SBW's [ITrackableProjectile], its target UUID is the boss (or one of its crew),
 * it has not already been lured away by a flare (`isDistracted`), it is closing in, and its time to impact is below
 * the phase threshold (or it is within [PANIC_DISTANCE] blocks). The first time a missile qualifies the boss rolls
 * [BossAircraft.flareMissChance]: on a miss that missile is ignored for good ("the pilot did not notice").
 *
 * Reaction (flares only with [BossAircraft.defensiveFlares], off by default; the brain still breaks away): three flare bursts [FLARE_INTERVAL] ticks apart. Because a flare only distracts a missile that is within
 * 32 blocks and 60 degrees of its heading, a missile that is still undistracted inside [REINFORCE_DISTANCE] blocks gets
 * further single bursts (up to [MAX_EXTRA_BURSTS] per missile), so late flares still have a chance to seduce it.
 *
 * [tick] must run every boss tick, before `super.baseTick()`: SBW's `releaseDecoy` consumes `decoyInputDown` during
 * the vehicle tick. All state is per instance.
