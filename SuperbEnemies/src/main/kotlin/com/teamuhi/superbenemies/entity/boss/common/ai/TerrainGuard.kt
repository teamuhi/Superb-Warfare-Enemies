/**
 * Look-ahead terrain scan. Fans [RAY_COUNT] rays (+-[FAN_HALF_ANGLE] degrees) along the flight path, reads the
 * `MOTION_BLOCKING` heightmap every [STEP] blocks up to `speed * 60` blocks ahead and returns the lowest altitude
 * that is safe to fly at: the highest terrain on any ray plus a margin of `12 + speed * 3` (small enough for the 50 block cruise height).
 *
 * It complements the obstacle avoidance built into SBW's `aircraftLoiter`, which only runs while orbiting; the brain
 * consults this guard in every state.
 *
 * Cost: at most 7 rays * ~16 samples of heightmap reads, once every [SCAN_INTERVAL] ticks per boss; the result is cached in
 * between (the first call scans at once). Unloaded chunks are assumed to
 * be at a caller-supplied altitude. Heights are clamped to the world's minimum build height (End / void).
