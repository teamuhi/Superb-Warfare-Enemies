 * A hidden crew member (pilot or gunner) of a boss aircraft.

 * Superb Warfare's aircraft engine only accepts control input while the vehicle has a passenger (without one it
 * clears all inputs and lets the nose drop), and projectiles need a living shooter. This entity fills both roles.
 * It is invisible, silent, invulnerable, has no AI and is never saved: the boss re-creates it whenever it is missing.
 * The boss gives it its own name (set right after creation) so that kill messages for the boss's weapons read sensibly.
